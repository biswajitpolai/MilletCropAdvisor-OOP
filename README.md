MilletCropAdvisor-OOP
Project Overview
MilletCropAdvisor-OOP is an object-oriented programming-based recommendation system designed to help farmers choose the most suitable millet crops for cultivation based on environmental factors like soil type, pH level, temperature, and irrigation availability. The system models various millet types using OOP principles, allowing the user to get tailored recommendations on which millet to grow. Each millet type has its own recommendations on fertilizer use, sowing methods, and pest management.

This project demonstrates key OOP concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, while also providing a useful tool for sustainable millet farming practices.

Key Features
Object-Oriented Design: The system is designed using OOP principles, featuring an abstract base class for general millet attributes and concrete subclasses for specific millet varieties.
Millet Recommendation: Based on input conditions like soil pH, temperature, soil type, and irrigation availability, the system recommends a suitable millet variety.
Fertilizer and Pest Management Guidance: Each millet type has specific guidance for fertilizers and pest management.
Dynamic Sowing Method Suggestions: The system provides suitable sowing methods based on the type of millet.
How It Works
Input Requirements: The user provides information such as soil pH, soil type, temperature, and whether the land is irrigated or not.
Millet Matching: The system uses this information to match the most suitable millet variety based on predefined conditions for each millet.
Recommendation: The recommended millet is displayed along with details on fertilizers, sowing methods, and pest management.
