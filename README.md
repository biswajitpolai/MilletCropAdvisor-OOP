MilletCropAdvisor-
It is an object-oriented programming-based recommendation system designed to help farmers choose the most suitable millet crops for cultivation based on environmental factors like soil type, pH level, temperature, and irrigation availability.

This project used key OOP concepts such as Data abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.


How It Works?

Input Requirements: The user provides information such as soil pH, soil type, temperature, and whether the land is irrigated or not.

Millet Matching: The system uses this information to match the most suitable millet variety based on predefined conditions for each millet.

Recommendation: The recommended millet is displayed along with details on fertilizers, sowing methods, and pest management.
